# What is an ergonomic keyboard layout?

## Important points

ergonomic keyboards vs ergonomic keyboard layouts

historical development:
* Dvorak
* Bulgarian layout
* Neo
* this dumb German layout
* computerized optimization
* flame war: neo vs nordtast

An ergonomic keyboard layout is a certain arrangement of the letters on a keyboard
with the goal of minimizing the typist fingers' movement.

A quick look on Google for "ergonomic keyboard" reveals nice-looking curved keyboards,
but these have nothing to do with ergonomic keyboard **layouts**. In fact, using 
a standard QUERTY layout with an ergonomic keyboard is dumb, imho.

Although the idea of ergonomic keyboard layouts dates back to a time when still
more typewriters were in use than terminals, information on ergonomic keyboard
layouts on the web is scattered and nowhere the most common keyboard layouts are
discussed from a common point of view.

Having learned multiple keyboard layouts:
* Neo2
* Nordtast
* Dvorak
* Colemak
* AdNW

and seeing aforementioned deficiency, I will try to fix with this page.

AdNW, short for Aus der Neo-Welt (engl. "From the Neo world"), is a ergonomic 
keyboard layout for English and German text.

# Nordtast: When layout optimization really took off

# Aus der Neo Welt: The quasi standard
