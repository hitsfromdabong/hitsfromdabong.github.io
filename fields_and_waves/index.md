## Introduction

The theory of vector calculus is an extension of classical calculus to vector 
quantities.

The kind of quantities we deal with are:
* scalar fields
* vector fields

There are three kind of differential operators.
* The gradient. Scalar -> Vector
* The divergence. Vector -> Scalar
* The rotation. Vector -> Vector

These operations can be expressed with the Nabla operator:
$ \nabla $

Using these operators we can create conditions for classifying given fields:
* conservative field
* vortex field
* source field

### Electrodynamical quantities

$ \vec E, \vec D, \vec H, \vec B, \vec j, \vec A, \Phi (U), \rho $

### Let's take a look at Maxwell's equations!

# A gentle introduction to classical electrodynamics

At the heart of the classical foundation of physics lie Maxwell's equaitons:

$ \textrm{div} \vec B = 0 $

$ \textrm{div} \vec D = \rho $

$ \textrm{rot} \vec E = - \frac{\partial \vec B}{\partial t} $

$ \textrm{rot} \vec H = \vec j + \frac{\partial \vec D}{\partial t} $

Although currently these are part of the standard curriculum at Germany high schools,
the mathematics behind these, that is, *vector calculus* is not taught. This 

An alternative derivation of Maxwell's equations can be found [here](ffe).

## Gauss' Theorem

## Stokes' Theorem

# Derivation of the common law of induction

$ U_{\text{ind}} = - \frac{\d \Phi}{\d t} $
